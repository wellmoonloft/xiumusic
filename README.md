Based on the personal NAS music player, Navidrome server development, theoretically supports Subsonic server

## Introduction

**Xiu** is [a music anchor](https://www.douyu.com/7884070) that I often watch recently. There is a word Xiu in her name, so she is called **XiuMusic**.

Recently, a lot of things have been set up on the NAS. Among them, the music server uses Navidrome, and the client has chosen a lot, but only [Sonixd](https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd) feels good, but there is no mobile terminal, and There is a problem of the century, does not support lyrics ([issues](https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd/issues/332) the author said that there is a big plan to leap to v1.0 and solve the problem of lyrics, and Some current repos support it, but I tried several times without success)

So I need an APP like this:

1. Support lyrics

2. Support fuzzy search (simplified and traditional, this is a big problem, for example, if you search for Âë®Êù∞‰º¶ and Âë®Êù∞ÂÄ´)

3. Concise

4. Unified style of desktop and mobile UI

With these four requirements, I decided to make an APP for myself

This is developed and debugged on the server environment of [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) based on the interface of [Subsonic API](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp) , so in theory it supports Subsonic, Navidrome and Airsonic.

**Notice! ! !** The lyrics are saved in the sqlite at document. Currently, there is no export function. 

**Please use the latest version to pack it yourself. The version on the appstore has logic problems, but I want to improve it a bit before putting it on appstore**

------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Clone project

2. Delete ios and macos to regenerate

3. Execute `flutter create .` in the project directory

4. Execute `flutter packages get` in the project directory

#### MacOS/IOS

The following files are added
DebugProfile.entitlements
Release.entitlements

    <key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
    <true/>

Turn on lock screen playback
#### IOS
Info.plist
```
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
	<array>
		<string>audio</string>
	</array>
```
AndroidManifest.xml

```
<manifest xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools" ...>
  <!-- ADD THESE TWO PERMISSIONS -->
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK"/>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>

        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MEDIA_BUTTON" />
      </intent-filter>
    </receiver> 
  </application>
</manifest>
```

#### Use the lyrics search function

You need to set the api of Netease Cloud. According to the instructions of setting [NeteaseCloudMusicApi](https://github.com/Binaryify/NeteaseCloudMusicApi) here, after configuring one on [vercel](https://vercel.com/), set the api The domain name can be used after it is saved in the set lyrics server.
