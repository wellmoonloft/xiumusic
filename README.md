My Apple developer certificate has expired, so you need to build by yourself. Because it has been more than a year, I have just upgraded all the dependencies to ensure that it can run on IOS14+ and MAC OS13+. I have not tested other platforms (2024.10.8)
Although the lyrics can be displayed, the method of obtaining the lyrics is still difficult to use. If all your music is standard, then there is no problem, but many of the songs I listen to are recorded by streaming, which will result in the inability to automatically identify and need to be manually selected.

Based on the personal NAS music player, Navidrome server development, theoretically supports Subsonic server

## Introduction

**Xiu** is [a music anchor](https://www.douyu.com/7884070) that I often watch recently. There is a word Xiu in her name, so she is called **XiuMusic**.

This is developed and debugged on the server environment of [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) based on the interface of [Subsonic API](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp) , so all Subsonic api servers are supported. In the process, I got help from many people in the [Navidrome discord group](https://discord.gg/xh7j7yF), thank them.

**Notice** The lyrics are saved in the sqlite at document. Currently, there is no export function. 

The MacOS version is already on the [Appstore](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/xiu-music/id1667473545), you can download it directly

**iOS**

#### Use the lyrics search function

You need to set the api of Netease Cloud. According to the instructions of setting [NeteaseCloudMusicApi](https://github.com/Binaryify/NeteaseCloudMusicApi) here, after configuring one on [vercel](https://vercel.com/), set the api The domain name can be used after it is saved in the set lyrics server.
