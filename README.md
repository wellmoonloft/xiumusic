Based on the personal NAS music player, Navidrome server development, theoretically supports Subsonic server

 üá®üá≥[ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README-cn.md) | üá∫üá∏[English](README.md)

## Introduction

**Xiu** is [a music anchor](https://www.douyu.com/7884070) that I often watch recently. There is a word Xiu in her name, so she is called **XiuMusic**.

Recently, a lot of things have been set up on the NAS. Among them, the music server uses Navidrome, and the client has chosen a lot, but only [Sonixd](https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd) feels good, but there is no mobile terminal, and There is a problem of the century, does not support lyrics ([issues](https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd/issues/332) the author said that there is a big plan to leap to v1.0 and solve the problem of lyrics, and Some current repos support it, but I tried several times without success)

So I need an APP like this:

1. Support lyrics

2. Support fuzzy search (simplified and traditional, this is a big problem, for example, if you search for Âë®Êù∞‰º¶ and Âë®Êù∞ÂÄ´)

3. Concise (listening to music is listening to music)

4. Unified style of desktop and mobile UI

With these four requirements, I decided to make an APP for myself

This is developed and debugged on the server environment of [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) based on the interface of [Subsonic API](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp) , so in theory it supports Subsonic, Navidrome and Airsonic. If you want to play, you can download it and have a try. If the interface is the same, it should not be a big problem (most of the DIO requests are not wrong, it is recommended to eat when the network environment is good. Go back and make up for user interaction when you're done)

**Notice! ! !** The downloaded lyrics are saved in the database of the APP document. Currently, there is no export function. Play less and do not blame me for not being able to output lyrics.

[The v0.4 version of macOS has been released and can be used directly](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xiu-music/id1667473545)
This version has two problems:
1. The UI is locked during initialization. If your songs exceed 5000, it may be locked
2. Judgment refresh is based on the two data of getScanStatus interface, but I just learned that one of the data is unique to Navidrome, so it may need to be manually refreshed
v0.4.1 solves this problem, but I don't want to submit appstore frequently
Please note that v0.5.0 has updated the table structure, please delete the app and reinstall, do not update or overwrite

#### Use the lyrics search function

You need to set the api of Netease Cloud. According to the instructions of setting [NeteaseCloudMusicApi](https://github.com/Binaryify/NeteaseCloudMusicApi) here, after configuring one on [vercel](https://vercel.com/), set the api The domain name can be used after it is saved in the set lyrics server.
